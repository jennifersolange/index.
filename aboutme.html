<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="aboutme1">
        My name is Jennifer Solange, I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. I like going out to the movies
        in my spare time. I'm currently studying web development in school as well as astronomy. 
        I have a blue russian siamese mix kitten named Mystique like the from the x men. What I enjoy about 
        web development is how much it's challenging me, I've never done anything thing like this before
        so I appreciate learning a new skill.
